13. What is a higher order function? Describe what filter(), map(), reduce(), sort() do. Your Answer:

    map(): Creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element
    reduce(): Method that reduces array to a single value. The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator.
    sort(): Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns a sorted array.
